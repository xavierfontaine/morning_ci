# Good coding practices
Unit tests:
* testing that the smallest components of your code work.
* A widely used tool for that is `pytest`

Coding style (linting/formatting):
* In Python, there are coding guides widely adopted by the community. ([PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/))
* There are tools to check you are following those practices (`flake8`)
* There are tools to format automatically your code (`black`)


# Continuous integration (CI)
A shield preventing people to push bad stuff.
